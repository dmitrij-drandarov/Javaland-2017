This repository is a set of notes taken at Javaland 2017. It's supposed to be a growing knowledge base for the authors to develop articles and workshops from it. Don't expect this repo to be complete, understandable or even right. It's just a temporary dump.
 
 The chapters are organized via topics. Each topic has a set of metadata.
