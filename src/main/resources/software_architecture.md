# Software Architecture
This chapter could be branched into several smaller chapters. Let's see how our content works out and branch later.
 
## Talks
- "Vom Pair-Programming ...", Carola Lilienthal
 
## Content
- slide 10: backlog in a fixed-prize project. Already in the very first sprint unplanned changes! Agile very hard with fixed-prize projects.
- Already in the first year one sprint only refactoring! Carola: "That's the way software development works!" Shows that  software architecture evolves and has to be cared for.
- slide 24: That's the way it should be!
- slide 25: That's the way it's often seen in "real" projects: Arrows are getting shorter because velocity is slowing down.
- CRAP-Cycle: Create, Repair, Abandon, Replace.
- slide 33 Chunking = summarize concepts / thoughts
- modularization = one of three ways to create insight. That's the reason why modularization is so popular in good architectures. Java 9 brings a lot of good change in this direction!
- patterns = one of three ways to create insight
- slide 50 right picture: slicing via business logic. Also, Java 9 can help with this! 
 
## TL;DR
 
## Tasks
- Steven have a look at llsa.da, there should be films about software architecture
- Steven take picture from slide 7 to software engineering course
- Steven add to software engineering course: Velocity of a team and ways to messure it. What is a story point? Gummybears!

- Steven organize migrating all knowledge from here to other places (workshops, articles, talks, ...). Goal is to delete this repository and all its contents.
